Autodesk Revit is a building information modeling software for architects, 
structural engineers, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers, and contractors. 
The original software was developed by Charles River Software, founded in 1997,
renamed Revit Technology Corporation in 2000 and acquired by Autodesk in 2002. 
The software allows users to design a building and structure and its components in 3D, 
annotate the model with 2D drafting elements and access building information 
from the building model's database.[1] Revit is 4D building information modeling (BIM)
application capable with tools to plan and track various stages in the building's lifecycle,
from concept to construction and later maintenance and/or demolition.
